# Change Log

## [v4.0.1](https://github.com/kevinoid/swagger-spec-validator/tree/v4.0.1) (2019-11-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kevinoid/swagger-spec-validator/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1)

## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/kevinoid/swagger-spec-validator/tree/v4.0.0) (2019-11-03)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kevinoid/swagger-spec-validator/compare/v3.0.1...v4.0.0)

- **BREAKING** Drop support for Node &lt; 8.3.
- Default to https://validator.swagger.io instead of https://online.swagger.io
  which is newer and described in the swagger-api/validator-badge README and
  **supports OpenAPI Specification v3**.
- The `Content-Type` header is now sent on every request (since it is now
  required by `validator.swagger.io` and `online.swagger.io`).  It is
  determined from caller (or command-line) options, or file extension, or file
  content (which requires buffering the document before sending), in that order.
- Specification data may now be passed as `Uint8Array` in addition to
  `string`, `Buffer`, and `stream.Readable` types.
- New `url` option which allows specifying the validator URL separately from
  any request options and (optionally) as a `URL` object.
- Remove HTTPS workarounds for https://online.swagger.io which are no longer
  necessary (see swagger-api/validator-badge#98).
- Replace `pify` dependency with `util.promisify`.
- Dependency version updates.
